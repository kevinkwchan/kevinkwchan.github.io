  <p>Hi! I’m currently a UX research intern at <a href="https://jazaenergy.com" class="green dim">Jaza Energy</a>. Previously, I’ve been a product designer and user researcher at <a href="https://plangrid.com" class="green dim">@PlanGrid, an Autodesk Company</a>. And when I’m at school, I study Systems Design Engineering at the <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca" class="green dim">University of Waterloo</a>.</p>

  <p>I’ve read a lot of student portfolio blurbs. They often consist of “why you design”, parts of ther design process you’re drawn to, and your hobbies to show that you have a life outside of work.</p>

  <p>When I write this for real, I will probably talk about the time I stubbed my toe on a bowling ball in the middle of the night and woke up my parents because I thoguht my toe was going to fall off.</p>
