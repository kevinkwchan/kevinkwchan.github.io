		A lil' about me
	</div>
</section>

I'm fascinated by the way society and technology influence each other, and the resulting human experiences that arise from that relationship. 

This interest has manifested itself in product design, UX research and data science roles. I like to blend qualitative and quantitative data to tell stories about real people, and use those stories along with models I craft to facilitate discussions with teams on how to solve problems for customers.

Though my jobs have had different titles, I see the act of uncovering human experiences and mobilizing businesses to deliver products and services in a user-centric way to be the common thread that ties them together.

In my spare time, you can usually catch me break dancing at home or at a local session in town. It's the best way to express creativity, stay fit, and look cool while doing it. (In my opinion.)
