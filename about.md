Hi! I'm currently a UX research intern at {% include link.html content="Jaza Energy" link="https://jazaenergy.com" %}. Previously, I've been a product designer and user researcher at {% include link.html content="@PlanGrid, an Autodesk Company" link="https://plangrid.com" %}. And when I'm at school, I study Systems Design Engineering at the {% include link.html content="University of Waterloo" link="https://uwaterloo.ca" %}.

I’ve read a lot of student portfolio blurbs. They often consist of “why you design”, parts of ther design process you’re drawn to, and your hobbies to show that you have a life outside of work.

When I write this for real, I will probably talk about the time I stubbed my toe on a bowling ball in the middle of the night and woke up my parents because I thoguht my toe was going to fall off.
